<!-- Write a logic that will dynamically change the content of this page based on controller parameters -->
<!-- for instance we know that the controller passes a variable called title -->
<!--Use this title to change the content of each page based on the route-->
<!--All content should be placed here for now-->
<!--Cleaner View Code - Everything has been seprated -->

<!--POST CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/post-content') %>
<!--AUTHOR CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/author-content') %>
<!--COMMENT CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/comment-content') %>
<!--CATEGORY CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/category-content') %>

<!--This is how you will dynamically change the content on the main page-->
